a. The developers of TrustedApp should have used the built in string comparison function instead of writing their own, which would have prevented the attack in task 2. Furthermore, they should not have stored the password in the clear. They should have chosen a password, hashed tha password, and then stored the hash in the app. Then when it receives a paramString, it would hash that string and then compare the hashes. Thus, even if the attacker knows what the hash is, they would be not be able to figure out the secret key is.
b. Renaming methods and variable names so it is more difficult to figure out what is going on?
